<h1>TOP 3 IPL TEAMS</h1>

  		<p class="content-name name1">MUMBAI INDIANS</p>
  		<p class="content">It has a mix of youngsters and experienced players led by Rohit Sharma the most successful captain in this league.
Although Mumbai is not my favourite team but I have a lot of respect for this franchise.
They have backups for every player and their bench strength is stronger than most squads in the current IPL.Half the battle is won at the auctions and Mumbai in the previous decade has invested in the right players.There are so many match winners in the team.They surely are the favourites.</p>

  	<div class="box">
   		<p class="content-name name2">CSK</p>
   		<p class="content">The yellow army makes one of the largest fan bases in the league. CSK has made more appearances in the playoffs when compared to any other side in the Indian Premier League. They also boast the highest win percentage in the history of this league. Chennai defended a 116 run total against Kings XI Punjab in 2009 which is another record.</p>

  	<div class="box">
  		<p class="content-name name3">KINGS X1 PUNJAB</p>
  		<p class="content">Kolkata Knight Riders are always one of the teams to watch out for in the Indian Premier League. The team owned by Shah Rukh Khan always has some big names in the line-up, but that's where KKR fans will be slightly disappointed as no big Indian players are in the team.</p>
